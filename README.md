# Around The Block

Around the Block is a website designed to help people find new neighborhoods to live in and/or explore.  Using Around the Block gives the user a *feel* for the locale and culture rather than a simple real estate search. Several websites already exist that help people search for a new house or apartment, so Around The Block offers something we felt was missing...a site that allows users to explore the unique characteristics of any city they search for!
